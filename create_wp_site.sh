#  What is wanted here is a simple way for me to create new websites
#  on a server at any point in time for the logged in user. The logged
#  in user will need to have sudo privileges. This is script is probably
#  more specific to my own needs than to others, but is provided to
#  others so that they can use and/or modify as needed.
